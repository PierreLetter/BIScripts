# BITools

This repo is where I'll be sharing mainly BI scripts for anybody in the BI Community to use. You'll also find some other things that could be useful that I got off the net and edited myself. Here is a list of the folders and their contents:


# Contents
For details you'll find a Readme file in each directory.

## DB Scripts

## Other Scripts
